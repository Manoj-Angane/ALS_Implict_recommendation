## Introduction
<b>Recommendation systems are probably the most trending data science application today. They can be used to predict users rating or preference for any particular item. All of the major tech companies are using recommendation system in some form or the other. Amazon is using it to suggest "frequently bought together" or "Customers who viewed this item also viewed". YouTube is using it to create an auto playlist based on your preferences. Infact, for companies like Netflix and Spotify, the entire business model and its success revolves around how good their recommandation system is. What's more, Netflix offered a million dollar prize competition in year 2009 to improve its system prediction by 10%.</b>
